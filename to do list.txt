	function: initialize game
		randomly generate solution sequence
		clear any arrays from last game
			(guess arrays, solution arrays)
		event listeners on full bead array
		

	function: playRound
		populate currentTry (row) bead cells with EventListeners

		make first one (A cell) glow or pulse

		allow user to click on another cell in the row to turn on the glow there, turn off glow in previously glowing cell.

		when user clicks on one of the beads in the full bead array, populate the glowing cell with that bead.

		when each bead cell has a bead, display "go!" button over label cell.
			- turn off eventListeners in the currentTry bead cells
			- populate the try[currentTry]beadArray with the bead sequence from the submitted row
			- compare the guess array with the solution sequence. 
				- first compare for exact matches. Any exact matches get recorded as 2 in the try[currentTry]scoreArray.
				- for cells in the guess array that don't generate an exact match, check to see if they match any bead in the solution sequence. Correct color match (but incorrect position match) gets scored as a 1 in the appropriate score Array.

		populate score cells in appropriate row with solid dots and/or hollow dots and/or blank spaces per the appropriate scoreArray. 

		if scoreArray === [2, 2, 2, 2], run gameWon function
		if scoreArray !== [2, 2, 2, 2] && currentTry === 8, run gameLost function


	function: gameOver
		turn off all try cell and fullBead array listeners.
		reveal solution sequence.
		try again? message (if yes, run initialize function)



	function: gameWon
		run gameOver function
		display some kind of "yay, you win!" message
		play happy sounds?


	function: gameLost
		run gameOver function
		display some kind of "you just got caught still guessing at the end of the game" message

	should these be helper functions?
		function: selectTargetCell
		function: selectBeadForCell
		function: detectIfBeadArrayIsFull
		function: submitBeadArray
